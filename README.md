# Incentive-Based Compensation in Police Forces — Replication Package

This repository contains the replication materials for **“Incentive-Based Compensation in Police Forces”**, accepted for publication in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management


Software requirements
```text
	•	R:
	•	Packages:Recommended: use renv for exact replication
	•	Stata: not required / required only to open .dta outputs (depending on your workflow).

Data
The DATA/ folder contains (i) raw data organized by source and (ii) the main dataset used in the paper.


Raw data by source
DATA/_police/
Police-source datasets, including:
```text
	•	Base_DP_consolidado: crime records available from the Instituto de Segurança Pública do Rio de Janeiro portal: https://www.ispdados.rj.gov.br/
	•	efetivo_aisp_upp: number of police officers assigned to each Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora (UPP)
	•	efetivo_aisp: number of police officers assigned to each Área Integrada de Segurança Pública (AISP), which is equivalent to a police battalion area
```
DATA/_target/
Information on crime targets set by the Secretariat of Security.
DATA/_population/
Population measures at the AISP level.
DATA/_geo/
Geographic information for AISP areas (e.g., identifiers/crosswalks and/or spatial boundaries).


Constructed datasets
```text
	•	DATA/final_data_SIM.dta is the main analysis dataset used in the paper.
	•	This dataset is generated by the data-construction pipeline:
		◦	Analysis/01-construction.R (raw + auxiliary sources → final dataset)
```

Code (Analysis folder)

All program files are located in the Analysis/ folder. The main entry point is MASTER.R, which calls the remaining scripts and exports estimations into user-friendly tables.


Execution order
Scripts are numbered to indicate the intended order:
```text
	•	01-*.R should be run first
	•	02-*.R second
	•	03-*.R robustness analyses (run as needed)
```

Scripts with the same number (e.g., the two 02-... scripts) can be run in any order after prerequisites are completed.

Script descriptions
```text
	•	MASTER.R: Main replication driver (recommended entry point)
	•	01-construction.R: Creates the final dataset based on the intermediate dataset and auxiliary sources
	•	02-analysis-descriptives.R: Executes and exports descriptive analysis
	•	02-analysis-main.R: Executes and exports main regression analysis
	•	03-robustness-spatial2.R: Executes and exports spatial regression analysis
	•	03-robustness-placebo.R: Executes and exports placebo regression analysis
	•	03-robustness-poisson.R: Executes and exports Poisson regression analysis
	•	utils.R: Helper functions used across scripts
```

Outputs

Running MASTER.R reproduces the results in the paper and exports outputs to:
```text
	•	Output/tables/
```
